## Overview and Purpose
  
  The project is in support of Roza, to generate an interactive web site with user dashboard with the purpose viewing bacteria sample test results. The samples are from volunteers who donated samples of their belly button bacteria. They can view their test results by using a private "Test Subject ID Number". The web page was created using JavaScript and HTML, and is interactive allowing the viewing of the bacteria species data and to identify the  species found in the donor's navel.


   The deliverables are:  
   
   - Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
   - Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
   - Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
   - Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard
